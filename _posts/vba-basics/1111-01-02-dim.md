## Dim

Before I explain `Dim`, lets talk about something more practical. Consider something like a container in which you can put anything in i.e. food, toys, clothes, and water. In VBA, we also need containers to hold data; however, we don't have physical containers but virtual containers called `Dim` and we **have** to give the container a name. The name can be anythng you want. I hope that gives you some idea of what a `Dim` is. If it doesn't make sense yet, don't worry the examples below should clear up your confusion.

```vb.net
Dim MyNumber          ' Make a container. At this point, it is empty
MyNumber = 9          ' Lets put the number 9 in there
Debug.Print MyNumber  ' Lets print out whats in the container
MyNumber = 11         ' Lets put remove 9 and put 11 in there
Debug.Print MyNumber  ' Lets print out whats in the container
```
> **Output**

```
9
11
```

## Houston. We have a problem

In real life, a container can have anything in them. Like I said before, containers can have juice, food, or water. Similarily, a `Dim` can have any type of data mentioned [here]({{ site.home }}/vb-basics/data-types); so in order to differentiate between we put the keyword `As` followed by the name of the data type when we make the container itself. Lets ammend the previous example and fix the issue.


```vb.net
Dim MyNumber As Integer   ' Make a container which only accepts Integer (or a number)
                          ' At this point, it is empty
MyNumber = 9              ' Lets put the number 9 in there
Debug.Print MyNumber      ' Lets print out whats in the container
MyNumber = 11             ' Lets put remove 9 and put 11 in there
Debug.Print MyNumber      ' Lets print out whats in the container

' Here is where it gets interesting
' Lets try to put some other type in the container i.e. String (or text)

MyNumber = "Random Text"  ' Will this work?
```
> **Output**

```
Program won't even work because MyNumber was assigned something other than 
a number
```
